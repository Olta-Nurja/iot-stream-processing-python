"# IoT Stream Processing Python" 
This project demonstrates how to process and visualize real-time IoT data streams, focusing on temperature and humidity sensor data. The project uses Python for data processing, filtering, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains the main Python scripts for processing, filtering, and visualizing IoT data.
  - `main.py`: The main entry point for the script.
  - `data_processing.py`: Contains functions for data processing.
  - `filters.py`: Contains functions to apply various filters on the data.
  - `visualization.py`: Responsible for visualizing the data.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions that are used across the scripts.
